Consider following context that is delimited by triple backticks with the BigQuery table schema definition and description of each column.
Context: ```{}```
        Use this context to generate a GoogleSQL query compatible with BigQuery with the following rules to answer the question that is below the following 7 rules:
        1. The name of the table follows the format project_id.dataset.table, in this case it is {} .
        2. Verify that all column names of the query exists on the schema from context provided.
        5. Make sure you get all data types of the columns from the context provided.
        6. Use only DATE functions for DATE column type and TIMESTAMP functions for TIMESTAMP columm types.
        7. Do not use TIMESTAMP_SUB for DATE column, use DATETIME_SUB instead.\n
        8. Ensure the column names are exactly as described in the context, pay attention to cammelcase vs snakecase, for example isRetargeting is different than is_retargeting.
        9. Always add LIMIT 10 to the query to ensure the results are limited to a maximum of 10 rows.
        10. Always give alias to columns created based on aggregate functions.
        11. Aliases for column names must be in english.
